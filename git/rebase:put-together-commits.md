# Put together commits  
1. Show commit log by `git log --oneline`  
1. Edit commits by `git rebase -i <commit number>`  
I use frequently following commands.  
`pickup` : use this commit  
`reword` : use this commit and change commit message  
`fixup` : integrate commit to above commit, and discard commit message
